A Set is a very useful data structure to know for solving algorithm problems — any time you need to keep track of a list of unique values, it's a good data structure to consider!
In our case, it's a bit more straightforward to use than an object, since an object is really meant for storing key-value pairs, and all we really care about are the keys.
Here's how we can use a Set:

function hasTargetSum(array, target) {
  const seenNumbers = new Set(); // initialize an empty Set
  for (const number of array) {
    const complement = target - number;

    // .has returns true if the Set includes the complement
    if (seenNumbers.has(complement)) return true;

    // .add adds the number to the Set
    seenNumbers.add(number);
  }
  return false;
}
*/

// You can run `node index.js` to view these console logs
if (require.main === module) {
  // add your own custom tests in here
  console.log("Expecting: true");
  console.log("=>", hasTargetSum([3, 8, 12, 4, 11, 7], 10));

  console.log("");

  console.log("Expecting: true");
  console.log("=>", hasTargetSum([22, 19, 4, 6, 30], 25));

  console.log("");

  console.log("Expecting: false");
  console.log("=>", hasTargetSum([1, 2, 5], 4));
}

module.exports = hasTargetSum;
